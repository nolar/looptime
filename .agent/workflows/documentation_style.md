description: Documentation style rules for looptime RST files
---

All `.rst` documentation files in this project must follow these styling rules:

### Page Title
The page title must be enclosed in double-equal signs (`=`) both on top and at the bottom. The length of the underline/overline must match the title length.

Example:
```rst
==========
Page Title
==========
```

### 1st Level Header
The first level header (section) must be underlined with double-equal signs (`=`).

Example:
```rst
Section Name
============
```

### 2nd Level Header
The second level header (sub-section) must be underlined with single-dash characters (`-`).

Example:
```rst
Sub-section Name
----------------
```

### 3rd Level and deeper
If needed, use `~` for 3rd level and `^` for 4th level headers.
